**Caution**: In a real-world scenario, setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` is risky, as it means any website can read the content of your site via AJAX requests. This would generally be a bad idea outside of a controlled demonstration environment. Always ensure you are following best practices and understand the implications of the configurations you apply.
