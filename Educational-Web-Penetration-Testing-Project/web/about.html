            <h1 class="text-center">About the Project</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Web Penetration Testing Project. This endeavor is not just a project, but a culmination of
                my dedication and hard work during my Junior Developer Training at Codersbay. Diving deep into languages
                and technologies such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP, I wanted to produce something that stands
                as a testament to my learning journey and also serves a wider community.</p>

            <p>This platform is conceived with the idea to provide a hands-on introduction for those curious about
                penetration testing. More than just presenting vulnerabilities, it aims to educate users on potential
                threats in web development. Each vulnerability has been thoroughly documented in
                <a href="vulnerabilities.html">Vulnerabilities</a>, but the real challenge and learning come from
                discovering these vulnerabilities yourself.</p>

            <p>For those keen on a structured approach, there's a dedicated learning section. It offers a deep dive into
                various vulnerabilities, their implications, and preventive measures. Head over
                to <a href="learning.html">Learning</a> for a comprehensive understanding and tutorials on the topic.
            </p>

            <p>If you're passionate about web security and wish to contribute to this educational project, I'd be
                thrilled to have your expertise. This project's codebase is hosted on GitHub for collaborative and
                educational purposes. Before you proceed, it's vital to understand that this repository has intentional
                vulnerabilities and is NOT meant for production or live deployment. Instead, it's an educational tool to
                learn about web security. You can access the GitHub repository
                <a href="https://github.com/Revc0/Java-Web-Penetration-Test" target="_blank"> here</a>. Whether you're
                interested in identifying new
                vulnerabilities, enhancing the UI, writing documentation, or even just fixing bugs, every contribution
                helps improve the platform for the community. Your feedback and collaboration will be invaluable in
                refining this platform further.</p>

            <p>I hope this project offers a blend of challenge and learning for all its users. Happy exploring!</p>
