## Introduction

This project was developed with the aim to understand web security from a hands-on perspective. The website contains intentional security flaws, allowing users to practice penetration testing techniques in a controlled environment.

## Vulnerabilities Tested üö™

The following vulnerabilities have been introduced and can be tested against:

- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Flaws in the login & registration system that allow for unauthorized data access or even database control.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Vulnerable comment sections allow for script injection, which can be used for a variety of attacks, including stealing session cookies.
- **Flawed File Upload**: Poorly implemented file upload functionality may allow for malicious files to be uploaded and executed.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Implemented features can be manipulated to trick end users into performing actions without their explicit consent.
- **Insecure Session Management**: Sessions can be hijacked or manipulated due to flaws in the session handling process.

## Setup and Installation üìö

### Prerequisites

- A Virtual Private Server (VPS) with a running web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
- A database management system (e.g., MySQL) set up on the VPS.
- Git installed on your VPS for cloning the repository.

### Steps

1. **Connect to Your VPS**:
   Use SSH (or your preferred method) to connect to your VPS:
   ```bash
   ssh your_username@your_vps_ip

   
2. Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Revc0/Java-Penetration-Test]

3. Navigate to the Web Root Directory:
- Depending on your web server setup, this might be `/var/www/html` or another directory. Move the project files there:
    ```bash
    mv [directory_name] /var/www/html/

4. Set Up the Database:
- Import the SQL file provided in the repository to your database management system to initialize the database.
- Modify any database configuration files in the project to match your VPS's database settings.

5. Access the Web Application
- Now you should be able to access the website using your VPS's IP address or domain name, if you have one associated.


### Usage üêí
1. Exploration
- Navigate through the website using your VPS's IP or domain, familiarize yourself with its features.
- Register an account, post comments, and interact with all available features to understand their workings.
   
2. Penetration Testing
- Use tools or manual techniques to exploit the intentionally introduced vulnerabilities. This includes SQL injections,          XSS attacks, and more.
- Document any successful attacks for later reporting.
- Always remember to act responsibly. Only test on systems you have permission to.

3. Mitigation:
- Once you've identified vulnerabilities, try to fix them using secure coding practices. This will give you a full-circle     
  experience from identifying vulnerabilities to patching them up.
