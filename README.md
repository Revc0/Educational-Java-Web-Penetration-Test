# Java Web Penetration Testing Project üî∞

This project showcases a purposely vulnerable web application, designed to illustrate common security flaws found in web applications. The project provides practical experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating these vulnerabilities.
Keep in Mind this project is not 100% finished because i have my focus on another project but i wanted to realease it for the public to explore. 
Feel free to add to the project and make it a better.

## Introduction

This project was developed with the aim to understand web security from a hands-on perspective. The website contains intentional security flaws, allowing users to practice penetration testing techniques in a controlled environment.

## Vulnerabilities Tested üö™

The following vulnerabilities have been introduced and can be tested against:

- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Flaws in the login & registration system that allow for unauthorized data access or even database control.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Vulnerable comment sections allow for script injection, which can be used for a variety of attacks, including stealing session cookies.
- **Flawed File Upload**: Poorly implemented file upload functionality may allow for malicious files to be uploaded and executed.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Implemented features can be manipulated to trick end users into performing actions without their explicit consent.
- **Insecure Session Management**: Sessions can be hijacked or manipulated due to flaws in the session handling process.

## Setup and Installation üìö

### Prerequisites

- Virtualization Software: Install a virtualization platform such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.
- Guest OS Image: A preferred operating system image, e.g., Ubuntu Server.
- Web Server Environment: Depending on your OS choice, this could be LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for Linux or XAMPP/MAMP for Windows/Mac respectively.
- Git: To clone the repository.

### Steps

1. **Create & Setup the Virtual Machine:**
- Launch your virtualization software.
- Set up a new virtual machine.
- Install your chosen operating system.

   
2. **Install the Web Environment:**
- Based on your OS, set up the appropriate web environment. For instance, on Ubuntu, you might install a LAMP stack.
    ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Revc0/Java-Penetration-Test]
    
3. **Install Additional Tools:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git

4. **Clone the Repository:**
- Open a terminal in the VM.
    ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Revc0/Java-Penetration-Test]

5. **Navigate to the Web Root Directory:`**
- The directory would depend on your setup. For LAMP on Ubuntu, it might be /var/www/html.
    ```bash
   sudo mv [directory_name] /var/www/html/

6. **Set Up the Database:**
- If using LAMP, access phpMyAdmin or your database interface.
- Import the SQL file provided in the repository.
- Update any configuration files in the project to match the VM's database settings.

7. **Access the Web Application:**
- Determine the VM's IP address (using ip a for Linux).
- On your host machine, access the website by entering the VM's IP in a browser, followed by the project directory if placed in a specific folder.

Note: Ensure that your VM's network settings (like in VirtualBox or VMware) are configured to allow easy access from the host machine. Typically, settings like "Bridged Adapter" or "NAT" would be suitable. Also, adjust firewall settings in the VM if necessary.

### Usage üêí
1. **Exploration**
- Navigate through the website using your VM's IP address, familiarize yourself with its features.
- Register an account, post comments, and interact with all available features to understand their workings.

2. **Penetration Testing**
- Ensure your VM's network settings are isolated to prevent unintentional breaches outside the virtual environment.
- Use tools or manual techniques to exploit the intentionally introduced vulnerabilities. This includes SQL injections, XSS attacks, and more.
- Document any successful attacks for later reporting.
- Always remember to act responsibly. Only test on systems you have permission to, and ensure the VM doesn't accidentally have access to critical networks.
- I also added an ATTACKERS-PAGE with several scripts to execute in this educational environment. (These scripts are specifically made for this environment, nothing crazy, but you can add more to them if you'd like to)
  
3. **Mitigation:**
- Once you've identified vulnerabilities within the VM environment, attempt to fix them using secure coding practices.
- This experience provides an understanding from both identifying vulnerabilities to the process of patching them, all within a controlled and safe environment.

## Future Plans üöÄ

As a solo developer, I have ambitious plans to enhance this project in the future:

- **Adding More Vulnerabilities**: I'll continue to introduce additional vulnerabilities to provide a wider range of security testing scenarios. This will allow users to explore and practice with a broader set of challenges.

- **Documentation Expansion**: I'm committed to expanding the project's documentation to offer more comprehensive guidance and educational resources. This will include detailed tutorials, write-ups, and explanations of common security flaws.

- **Creating a Tool**: To streamline the process of executing scripts and conducting security testing within this educational environment, I'm planning to develop a dedicated tool. This tool will simplify the setup, execution, and reporting of security tests.

- **Community Engagement**: I intend to foster a community around this project, encouraging others interested in web security to contribute, share insights, and collaborate on making this project even more valuable.

- **Advanced Challenges**: In addition to the existing vulnerabilities, I'll design more advanced challenges that provide opportunities for users to hone their skills in a controlled environment.

- **Integration with Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges**: Exploring the possibility of integrating this project with Capture The Flag challenges to offer a gamified learning experience in web security.

- **Regular Updates**: I'll keep the project up-to-date with the latest web security trends and vulnerabilities to ensure that it remains a relevant and valuable resource.

- **Feedback and Improvements**: I welcome feedback from the community and will use it to continually improve the project. User suggestions and insights are invaluable for enhancing the educational value of this environment.

- **Live Website Version**: I aspire to develop a live website version of this project that allows users to explore and test security vulnerabilities directly on the web. This will involve creating a safe and controlled virtual environment within the website where users can register, log in, and interact with intentionally vulnerable features in a secure manner. It will provide a seamless and accessible platform for users to practice web penetration testing without the need for setting up a virtual machine locally. This live version will expand accessibility and make it even easier for individuals to learn and improve their web security skills.

By working diligently on these future plans, I aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamic platform for web security enthusiasts to learn, practice, and grow their skills.
